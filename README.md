## Initial Requests

To develop an image compression app with the following features:

- After opening the application, users can upload images in formats such as PNG and JPG, and then compress them according to the desired ratio to reduce the file size.
- Both the uploaded images and the compressed images should be previewable on the webpage, helping users verify whether the uploaded images are correct and whether the compression results meet their expectations.
- You need to display the file sizes before and after compression.
- Allow users to download the compressed images.
